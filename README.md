Client-Server Application

This is a simple client-server application that uses socket programming to enable communication between two machines over a network. The server listens for incoming connections from clients, and the client can send data to the server.
Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system.
Usage

    Start the server by running the server.py script on a machine that is connected to the network.

python server.py

Start the client by running the client.py script on a different machine that is connected to the same network.

python client.py

The client will connect to the server and send a message. The server will receive the message and send a response back to the client.

The client will display the response from the server.
